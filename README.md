Here, we are using the MNIST dataset is a widely used as a benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision.
It consists of a collection of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, along with their corresponding labels.
The dataset is split into a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
